More SDL experiments.

End result will hopefully be some sort of Worms clone.

Things that are currently implemented:
* Camera with three tracking modes: None, Loose and Strict.
* Very expensive terrain drawing.
* Terrain destruction.
* Movement controls with basic terrain collision.

A lot of optimization needs to be done.
